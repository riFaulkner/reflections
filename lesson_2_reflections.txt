When a repository is initialized git takes information about the repository,
 such as where it is and then tracks what files are in it for later use.
 In all honesty Im not too sure what it does this is just my best guess.

The stating area is different form the working directory because it is like 
 a snapshot of where your working directory is before a commit. This gives the
 user more flexablitly and control over what files a commit will change.
