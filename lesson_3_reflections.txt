You almost always want to use a remote repository rather than keeping everything on a local machine. 
 Using a remote repo makes it easy to transfer between devices as well as let other people contribute
 to the work that you are doing. Also having a copy elsewhere makes it so if one device fails your 
 work is still safe and sound.
